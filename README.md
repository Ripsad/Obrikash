In this repo i am trying to learn new data structures, use new algorithms that are well optimized, analyzing O notation.
Also, this is a good way for me to master the git usage, 'cause this is my "first" time using git. I hope i'll success
at it and be a really good developer who knows its area. There'll be a mix of my work from univeristy, and my personal
learning.
